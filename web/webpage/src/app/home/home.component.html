    <u>note about speech usage:</u><br />
    this page uses the browsers text to speech api to talk to you.<br />
    due to the now more restrictive autoplay handling of the browsers speech api you have to click somewhere on the page to hear the voice texts.<br />
    this shouldn't be an issue except that on entering this home page there is no spoken text. as soon as you use the navigation tabs it starts working.<br />
    see <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5687444770914304">chrome platform status entry</a> for more details.<br />
